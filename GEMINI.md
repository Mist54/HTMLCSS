# Project Overview

This is a single-page portfolio website for a software developer named "Mist". It is designed to showcase their skills and projects to potential employers or clients.

## Key Technologies

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Frameworks/Libraries:** Bootstrap 5

## Architecture

The project follows a simple, static website structure:

*   `portfolio.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
*   `CSS/style.css`: The custom stylesheet for the website, including a light and dark theme.
*   `JS/script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles all the dynamic and interactive elements of the portfolio.

# Building and Running

This is a static website and does not require a build process. To run the project, simply open the `portfolio.html` file in a web browser.

# Development Conventions

## Coding Style

*   The code follows standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript conventions.
*   The CSS uses variables for theming and a consistent naming scheme.
*   The JavaScript is well-commented and organized into sections based on functionality.

## Interactivity & Easter Eggs

The website is highly interactive and includes several "fun" features and easter eggs:

*   **Theme Toggle:** Users can switch between light and dark themes.
*   **Animations:** The site uses numerous animations to create a dynamic user experience.
*   **Easter Eggs:**
    *   A "code rain" effect is triggered by the Konami code (`Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A`).
    *   A confetti explosion occurs when the brand name is clicked five times.

## Customization

To customize the portfolio, you will need to edit the following files:

*   **`portfolio.html`**: To change the content (e.g., your name, bio, projects).
*   **`CSS/style.css`**: To change the visual appearance of the site.
*   **`JS/script.js`**: To modify the interactive behavior and animations.

### Key Customization Points:

*   **`portfolio.html`**:
    *   Update the `<title>` to reflect your name and specialization.
    *   Replace `"YOUR_GITHUB"` and `"YOUR_LINKEDIN"` with your actual profile URLs.
    *   Update the "Projects" section with your own projects.
    *   Change the email address in the "Contact" section and the contact modal.
*   **`JS/script.js`**:
    *   Modify the `roles` array in the typing rotator to reflect your skills and experience.
